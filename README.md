**Hey there! This is my take on a terminal monitor for SDR hardware.** I wanted something that could hunt down every bit of diagnostic data from your radio and stream it straight to your terminal.

I didn't want to cut corners, so this definitely isn't a lazy `hackrf_info` clone. It delivers raw, real-time metrics (spectrum, waterfall, ADC health, gain chain) right inside the terminal. It's lightweight, distraction-free, and fits perfectly into a tmux pane, an SSH session, or the custom screen of your cyberdeck.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Project Status:** `sdrtop` is currently in an **early development stage**. 
> * At the moment, **it only supports the HackRF One**. Support for other devices is planned.
> * **Known Issues: **Plenty 😄... You might run into some performance issues.

## What it shows

- **Spectrum analyzer** — FFT with EMA smoothing, peak hold, noise floor, dBFS axis, zoom, band plan overlay, frequency markers
- **Waterfall** — scrolling spectrogram with truecolor / 256-color / 16-color support
- **Signal strip** — live bar: P/NF · channel power · noise floor · ADC saturation · drops · buffer fill · IQ imbalance · RBW
- **RF chain** — baseband filter BW, total gain, CPLD status, ADC utilisation gauge, gain advisor
- **IQ diagnostics** — DC offset (I/Q + magnitude gauge), amplitude imbalance, phase imbalance, contextual hint
- **Hardware health** — drop rate + trend, ADC saturation + trend, USB jitter, USB errors + trend (all with sparklines)
- **IQ histogram** — ADC amplitude distribution; flags clipping and dynamic range issues
- **Observer mode** — device identity and owner process when another app holds the radio
- **Six themes** — `sdr` · `nord` · `dracula` · `gruvbox` · `catppuccin` · `solarized`
- **Layout presets** — five presets, switch on the fly with number keys or cycle with `p`

## Config

Saved automatically to `~/.config/sdrtop/config.toml` on quit. Hand-editing is safe.

```toml
[radio]
frequency_hz = 92800000
sample_rate  = 2000000.0
lna_gain     = 24
vga_gain     = 30
amp_enabled  = false

[display]
active_preset      = "main"
waterfall_max_rows = 64

# Spectrum markers persist here
[[display.spectrum_markers]]
freq_hz = 92800000
label   = "FM Radio"

[theme]
base = "nord"
# optional per-field overrides
# border_accent = "#88c0d0"
# value_hi      = "#ebcb8b"
```

Available themes: `sdr` (default) · `nord` · `dracula` · `gruvbox` · `catppuccin` · `solarized`

- [ ] HackRF Pro
- [ ] LimeSDR / bladeRF / SDRplay / PlutoSDR via SoapySDR

### App
- [ ] Frequency scanner mode
- [ ] Signal recording to file

## Supporting the project

`sdrtop` is built to support every SDR device out there, but that requires actually owning them. Right now development runs on a HackRF One and a PortaPack H4M. The next device on the list is an **RTL-SDR dongle**, which I'm buying myself - it's the most common SDR hardware in the world and the most impactful single addition this project can make.

The more expensive hardware (Airspy, LimeSDR, SDRplay) I'm saving toward as well, but that takes longer. If you use `sdrtop` and want to see support for your device sooner, contributions go directly toward hardware purchases. Every device that arrives gets a proper backend: tested on real hardware, documented, shipped.

| Device               | Why it matters                                                    | Price |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ----- |
| RTL-SDR Blog V4      | Most common SDR dongle - immediate impact on user base            | ~€25  |
| Airspy Mini          | Clean 24–1700 MHz, popular with hams and scanner hobbyists        | ~€80  |
| Airspy HF+ Discovery | Best budget HF receiver, dedicated listener community             | ~€150 |
| LimeSDR Mini 2.0     | Full-duplex, wide range - opens up SoapySDR for dozens of devices | ~€160 |

No pressure, but if this scratches an itch for you, this is where it goes.
